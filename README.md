The Smart Lamp is an LED lamp that has an alarm and clock built in.
The purpose of the Smart Lamp was to reduce the user's electricity costs.
Since the bulb will automatically shut off when the project is illuminated.
People occasionally forget to switch off the lights, therefore this will help with cost savings.
This project uses an esp32, LCD, LDR, and buzzer to enable all of these uses.
C++ is used in the Smart Lamp's coding.
